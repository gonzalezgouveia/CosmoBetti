My intention is to refactor all the code I used during my master thesis at CIMAT (Guanajuato, Mexico) and at the same time learn how to put it in a R package and upload it in GitHub. In my thesis I analyse how betti curve can be implemented in a data science framework. My work can be seen on [This link](https://gonzalezgouveia.github.io/documents/TesisMaestriaRafael.pdf). Unfortunatelly by the time this documentation is been written (jan 2019) my work is only available in spanish. I am working on a English draft. You can also contact me via Git Hub if you are more interested on my work.
